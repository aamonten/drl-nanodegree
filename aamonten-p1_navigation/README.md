# Project 1: Navigation - Collecting (Yellow) Bananas

### Introduction

In this project, you will train an agent to collect bananas, discriminating by the color of the banana

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

To run this project you will need Python 3.6. By using [Conda](https://anaconda.com/download) you can create and activate an environment named drlnd, and install all required dependencies:

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
	

2. Clone this repository and go to `p1_navigation/` folder.  If you haven't already, [install pip](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pip), and finally 
install all project dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aamonten/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
cd p1_navigation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```

4. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu. 


5. Download Unity ML-agent environment specially prepared for this project from one of the links below. Select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
6. Place the downloaded file in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

### Let's get started
